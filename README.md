Hello! This is the ReadMe for the K Health automation assignment. If you look through the script, you'll notice that I am a supreme novice with automation. Unfortunately, I couldn't figure out the assertion portion. 

(I'm not sure if this is accurate so I'm detailing what I did.) In order to execute the script (assuming there is nothing installed on your computer), here's what you should do. First, download and install the Java Development Kit. It can be found here - https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html
Next, download and install the Eclipse IDE. It can be found here - https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/
Last, download and install the Selenium Java Client Driver, which can be found here - https://www.selenium.dev/downloads/
